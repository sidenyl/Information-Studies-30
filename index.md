Packet-Switching as a key innovation that made the internet possible – breaking info into pieces, sending it over network, and pieced back together. This was how the term “end-to-end” came to be. This allowed information to be recreated if any errors occur in the line of connection. “Virtual circuit” models came about to support the resources necessary to “manage flow of data” (Gillespie 432). Alternatively, other argued for the “datagram” model that would only allow endpoints to manage data. If the endpoints aren’t reached successfully, the entire process starts over again. The advantage of this model is that the intermediate nodes are faster at the expense of retransmission time. For time sensitive tasks such as real time streaming of data, the virtual circuit model is more efficient. Otherwise, the datagram model is preferable. While the computer science programs emphasized research on datagram, the telephony companies emphasized research on virtual circuits, so the competition between the two different sectors ensued over network dominance. For the internet, the datagram model was more efficient, but the intermediate nodes still perform some routing and congestion control functions. However, as the internet began to emerge as a public and commercial network, designers are looking from more than just sending and receiving information. One of the meaning of “end-to-end” was that two networks were adjacent, but this meaning disappeared when discussing computer networks as opposed to cable networks. Another common meaning of “end-to-end” was the path taken from the start to finish within the many different path that the packet-switching design offered. Throughout the 1970s, the meaning of ETE focused on the responsibility of the endpoints to send an acknowledgement (‘ack’) of completed transaction to the sender. Into the 1980s, datagram model won over the virtual circuit model as telephone networks moved form analog switches to digital relays. Thus, the term ETE works with any network design and also works with claim about the social change thru technology. Gillespie found from his readings that the ETE “principle leads directly to the principle of simplicity in network design.” In Saltzer, Reed, and Clark paper, they change the term ETE to stand for an ideal instead of a design. Techno-futurists saw an utopian future in technology post industrial modernism. Barlow believed in end user freedom and saw threat to online speech in states and powerful corporations intent to censor the internet. Commercially, using the term ETE helps sell the products. <br/>

Understanding the internet through social/cultural aspects and “its material specifities” (Dourish). Xerox paved the way to use IP on local scale. While Appletalk required little administrative effort to set up, TCP/IP networks requires set up. More in depth analysis can happen if the “internet” wasn’t a “singular phenomenon” (Dourish). Internet has many different layer of connection making it harder to understand just which set of layer means “decentralization.” Thus, the term “othernets” helps people to understand the internet as an “internetworking space of possibilities” (Dourish). In 1984 San Francisco, Jennings wrote up a software called Fido that would allow thousands of users to exchange messages and files. Fidonet’s design had a conventional structure – daily and weekly – and an immediate structure – communication in real time; the internet takes both these structures into account.

In the “As We May Think” article by Vannevar Bush, Bush looks into a future where technology amasses information in very little space. He compares technology to a spider web of metal providing cheap device with great reliability. He hypothesizes how the entire Encyclopedia Britannica could be reduced to the size of a matchbox. The introduction of the Voder machine at the World Fair displayed the conversion of text to speech. Complex arithmetic calculations can all be turned over to machines, so mathematicians are only necessary to “use symbolic logic on a high plane.” Bush coins the term “memex”; he describes it as “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.” This set up will allow selection by association, rather than by indexing. However look up of whatever the user chooses still requires indexing. </br>

In Nelson’s Computer Lib/Dream Machines, Nelson wants to bridge the gap between laymen and “computer people” through allowing his writing to explain the working of computer without watering the complexity of the info down. He sees “Professionalism” as a “clique of insider” who does not readily provides others the rightful information everyone deserves to know. In the “Dream Machines” section of his book, Nelson discusses how the school system structures every children education in a cookie cutter fashion that does not promote children’s innate creativity. In a similar fashion, Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) also fails to promote creative learning. People consider the teacher more “warm” and “human” whereas the computer is considered “cold” and “inhuman.” Nelson states that the computer is as “inhuman” as everyday household machines which people attribute to their warm. CAI is based off of three premises: (1) items which are short chunks and questions, (2) sequences arrangement of items, (3) dialogue which is a framework of embedded sequences. Sequenced Item Conversational systems (SIC) converse with students based of the CAI structure. The structured teaching of CAI needs extensive experimentation because of the all the many possible connection within the web and extensive debugging as a result. Additionally, the structured model of the CAI follows many of the same cookie cutter structure of the school system, dismissing creative learning. Though Nelson agrees that the “drill and practice” system helps to make correct adjustments in learning new material, a better method of learning would be for the student to control the system instead of allowing the computer system to control the student’s learning through “hyper-media.” Hyper-media includes the branching method of presentation that allows the user to act on different type of media such as words and pictures. <br/>

In Marcia Bates’s “The Design of Browsing and Berrypicking Techniques for the Online Search Interface,” she discusses the term “berrypicking” that she conveys as much more similar to how users actually search for information; using this method allows for better design of effective interfaces. “Berry-picking” differs from the traditional method of searching in the query, search process, range of search techniques, and information domain. Widely used strategies for searching include footnote chasing, journal run, area scanning, bibliographies-abstracting-indexing, and author searching.
